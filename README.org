* beer-o-meter

BEER-O-METER is an application which can tell management when it is
time to order the beer for a celebration of a team's software quality
improvements.

** Intention

This application intends to measure software quality improvements
using two sets of measurements, both defined in Fosgren, Humble, and
Kim's book [[https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339][Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps:
Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations]].

*** In terms of SOFTWARE DELIVERY PERFORMANCE: 

 - deploy frequency
 - lead time
 - mean time to restore
 - change fail %

*** In terms of QUALITY:

 - "unplanned work" and "rework"
 - "manual work"

*** Use Work Planning Data

 In the ICE Organization, we use [[https://www52.v1host.com/skatteministeriet/Default.aspx?menu=MyHomeEnterpriseGettingStartedPage][Version1 (aka Digital.AI Agility)]] to
 plan and manage our software work flow assets. In their [[https://docs.digital.ai/bundle/app-management/page/Developers-Library_10403644072.html][Developer's
 Library]], there exists a set of RESTful API's which will allow the
 application to query, process, and reduce the assets into the
 forementioned measurements.

** Background Reading

*** Version1

**** terminology
- Asset: Story / Backlog Item
- Asset Type: classes of data available
- Scope (system assets created within a scope or project)


** Planning

*** Preliminary
1. get a version1 access token (seems like it might be easier with
   username:password)
2. determine data model / contract of api
3. 

*** Query
`rest-1.v1/Data/Scope/688178/Workitems:Defect[Team.Name='Team Sagsproces']`
